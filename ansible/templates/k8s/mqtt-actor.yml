The invention of mechanical and electrical computing devices in the 19th and 20th centuries by pioneers such as Charles Babbage, Ada Lovelace and Alan Turing allowed such problems to be solved both more cheaply and more reliably. Nowadays, computers are immensely more powerful than they were in either Babbage’s or Turing’s time. We will describe a few mathematical problems that computers can solve, and present some of the key techniques, such as step-by-step iteration, recursion and Monte-Carlo simulation. We touch upon some modern computing tools, such as calculators, spreadsheets, programming languages etc. These tools are the present-day equivalents of Babbage’s and Turing’s machines, and are available to us all (often for free) in order to solve our everyday mathematical problems in work and in life. We end the talk by briefly speculating upon whether computing has anything to say about the nature of our lives and of the universe itself.\r\n","recorded":true,"link":"https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2022/102-using-computers-to-cheat-at-maths"}}]

For example in 2019, wired magazine introduced live coding with the headline “DJs of the future don’t spin records, they write code”, despite publishing very similar articles previously in 2013 (“Hacking meets clubbing with the Algorave”) and 2006 (“Real DJs Code Live”). In reality, live coders are not DJs and are not trying to replace them! Live coding is just another way of making music and other time-based artforms like video and choreography.\r\nSo this talk is about the _past_ of live coding, rather than the future -- we'll look at algorithmic artforms developed over millennia. Weaving and braiding are classic examples, highly developed algorithmic crafts found all round the world, reaching astonishing complexity. We'll also look 'heritage algorithms' like bell ringing patterns, juggling patterns, konnakol vocal patterns, and kollam drawings, and equivalent contemporary practices like bytebeat, bitfield and tidalcycles patterns.\r\nIn the end we'll ask, what do we gain from seeing the latter in terms of the former?

We’ll show you how the polar ice sheets have a crucial role in the workings of our planet, and how they are at risk of rapid changes that will affect people all over the world. We’ll introduce you to the fascinating science of glaciology – how we study ice and try and predict how it will change in the future. \r\n\r\nWe’ll demonstrate our research work on understanding this hidden environment. We create new methods for measuring how ice is changing: we design and deploy wireless electronic instruments that can measure conditions underneath deep ice to detect melting. These instruments communicate wirelessly through the ice so that we can investigate what’s going on under the ice in real time. \r\n\r\nThe talk will be presented by glaciologists from a UK university who have spent over 36 months in the polar regions, predominantly in Antarctica and Greenland. We’ve lived in tents in temperatures below -25 degrees, and have weathered the difficulties of getting electronics to work in the cold. We’ll share our experiences and love of cold places. For the more technical members of the EMFCamp audience, we will also give an overview of how we designed the instruments and talk about our future plans to create an open-source hardware community in glaciology and hydrology.

In 2011(version one) and 2012 (version 2) a commercial version, Sifteo Cubes, was released, but I was unaware, thinking the dream prototype was just that, a dream not a reality. They passed me by…\r\n\r\n In 2014, the v2 software was open sourced - the inevitable precursor to failure - and the company bought by Drone/Robotics developer for the obvious design skills of the Sifteo team; they had, after all, reverse engineered and reapplied wireless keyboard controllers into one of the coolest toys ever! So, I came to them late. Too late. By 2015, the server the control software required, along with the online marketplace for the dozen or so games that were made, were long gone. The Sifteo cubes I’d just (re)discovered from a desperate eBay sale were now just useless, battery powered bricks. And they didn’t even click together!\r\n\r\nBut I was stubborn. I wanted them to work. These little marvels of engineering and educational design. I had some of the software, a couple of the games, and none of the knowledge. Here’s how I managed to resurrect a legend, who I met, what some of them stole from me, and what I learned on the way","recorded":true,"link":"https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2022/106-sifteo-cubes-resurrecting-a-legend"}},{"start":"2022-06-04T18:30:00+01:00","venue":"Stage A","event":{"type":"talk","title":"Speed 3: Cruise Control","speaker":"Cybergibbons","pronouns":"He/him","description":"When I first watched Hackers in 1998, the idea of being able to remotely control ships seemed rather fanciful. After working on container ships as an engineer in the mid-2000s, it seemed every more unlikely. We didn't have a full-time Internet connection and all the vital systems were truly air-gapped. But things have changed - ships are becoming more and more connected and complex. \r\n\r\nAs a result, 15 years later, I found myself sat in my pants on the sofa with the ability to control the steering on one of the world's largest cruise ships. We've been able to brick every PLC across tens of oil rigs, pay for food as the captain, and write rude words on the side of the ship. \r\n\r\nTo get to this point, we had to go on a learning voyage across tens of different vessels, including offshore support tugs, super yachts, oil rigs and container ships. Join me on a whistle stop tour of what's on a ship, how it's all connected together, what threats there are and how we find the vulnerabilities.

Whether it's for usability, profit, safety, profit or 'sparking joy', or profit (it's usually profit), 'User Experience Design' was the flavour of the 2010s.

Tourism films are no use in a war, so the Council turned their topics towards more cultural content as a softer kind of propaganda. Thus began a decade of film production that would have phenomenal overseas impact but be almost totally forgotten in Britain. \r\n\r\nBetween 1940–1950, the British Council produced over 120 short documentary-style films about life in Britain covering sports, manufacturing, landscapes, art, architecture, public healthcare, the justice system, democratic process, public institutions like the National Trust and the BBC, and more besides. \r\nA far cry from the Ministry of Information's rigid style, this collection features some of the earliest works by winning cinematographers Geoffrey Unsworth (2001: A Space Odyssey, Cabaret, Superman), and Jack Cardiff (A Matter of Life and Death, Black Narcissus, The Red Shoes). \r\n\r\nDistributed to over 100 countries worldwide, the films are stunning, dated, funny, and bizarre by turn.

And what does that have to do with a teleporting duck in a classroom?!\r\n\r\nWe often hold creating 'a magical experience' as a key goal for design - it's fun, engaging, sometimes even playful, and it makes complex things look simple. But technological magic has a dark side too, especially when trying to help people learn and feel confident about technology.\r\n\r\nBy its nature, magic you experience is not under your control: it's a trick, and you're not supposed to be able to understand it; magic is inscrutable, and for many, that's disempowering.\r\n\r\nIn designing the BBC micro:bit and surrounding tools, we've thought a lot about the balance between the positive and the negative sides of creating of a magical experience.\r\n\r\nThis talk will reflect on our struggle to balance technical authenticity and honesty with the need to provide a high quality experience that excites and inspires students.\r\n\r\nIt will explain how we attempt to present simple, understandable analogs of more complicated, magical technology in order to help students gain a sense confidence with the tech around them.  However, it will also look at how we've resorted to using our own bits of (nearly) invisible magic to make this all work nicely in a classroom.\r\n\r\nThrough this discussion we'll look in detail at the presentation of the micro:bit's IO, the way the micro:bit's USB interface works, the microphone privacy LED, the web-based compiler and the simple radio communication.\r\n\r\nFinally, I will look beyond micro:bit at how using this concept of balancing transparency and magic can help us build better, more trustworthy tech.","recorded":true,"link":"https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2022/267-making-technology-deliberately-distinguishable-from-magic"}}]

A major barrier is that they are very expensive at thousands of pounds each and built to order with lead times of over a year. Rather like bagpipes, they are loud. For pipers, practice e-chanters are available while nothing similar exists for the hurdy-gurdy. The Digi-Gurdy project started as a 3D printed version of the keyboard part of the instrument in isolation, with some internal electronics, for my own personal use to learn a few tunes on. After posting on Thingiverse, a website for sharing 3D printed ideas, I had many requests from people asking me to build them one. This open-source project has developed through many variations which I would bring to the talk, resulting in an all laser-cut wooden full-size hurdy gurdy design with a realistic crank handle system and a detachable playable keybox for travelling. It is an electronic device, with correctly placed keys, that outputs data via the industry standard MIDI communications system for electronic musical instruments, via a USB cable to an attached or wirelessly paired phone or iPad running suitable MIDI player software.
