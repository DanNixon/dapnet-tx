The invention of mechanical and electrical computing devices in the 19th and 20th centuries by pioneers such as Charles Babbage, Ada Lovelace and Alan Turing allowed such problems to be solved both more cheaply and more reliably. Nowadays, computers are immensely more powerful than they were in either Babbage’s or Turing’s time. We will describe a few mathematical problems that computers can solve, and present some of the key techniques, such as step-by-step iteration, recursion and Monte-Carlo simulation. We touch upon some modern computing tools, such as calculators, spreadsheets, programming languages etc. These tools are the present-day equivalents of Babbage’s and Turing’s machines, and are available to us all (often for free) in order to solve our everyday mathematical problems in work and in life. We end the talk by briefly speculating upon whether computing has anything to say about the nature of our lives and of the universe itself.\r\n","link":"https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2022/102-using-computers-to-cheat-at-maths"}},{"start":"2022-06-03T11:00:00+01:00","venue":"Stage C","event":{"type":"talk","title":"2500 nerds, one pathetic robot","speaker":"Chris Stubbs & Dom Tag","pronouns":"","description":"The technical trials and tribulations of trying to allow 2500 nerds to remotely drive a pathetically inadequate robot around a field. \r\nWe cover all the do’s and don’ts of creating an adorable yet woefully inadequate rover. \r\nWe’ll then talk about how we addressed the issues and built a new version. \r\nAdditionally, covering how we made the new one actually fit a person inside it (Hacky Races). \r\nFinishing up with a live demo!","link":"https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2022/63-2500-nerds-one-pathetic-robot"}},{"start":"2022-06-03T11:00:00+01:00","venue":"Workshop 1","event":{"type":"workshop","title":"Badge Soldering Workshop @Nottinghack","speaker":"Nottinghack Village","pronouns":"","description":"Badge making using badge kits and soldering irons, simple little kits for adults and children to learn basic soldering.

In reality, live coders are not DJs and are not trying to replace them! Live coding is just another way of making music and other time-based artforms like video and choreography.\r\nSo this talk is about the _past_ of live coding, rather than the future -- we'll look at algorithmic artforms developed over millennia. Weaving and braiding are classic examples, highly developed algorithmic crafts found all round the world, reaching astonishing complexity. We'll also look 'heritage algorithms' like bell ringing patterns, juggling patterns, konnakol vocal patterns, and kollam drawings, and equivalent contemporary practices like bytebeat, bitfield and tidalcycles patterns.\r\nIn the end we'll ask, what do we gain from seeing the latter in terms of the former?

This isn't just a talk; in the live audience, you'll directly experience how to use senses you don't know you have, with participatory demonstrations tailored to the physical environment of EMF Camp, based on the skills and stimuli relied on every day by blind people like me. Practice during camp, and you'll sense more — permanently.\r\n\r\nYou'll have a better experience if you wear short sleeves, have your hair uncovered, and come together with someone with whom you're comfortable exchanging brief touch on the cheek, neck, or arm.\r\n\r\nI will be completely blindfolded for the entire talk.

Whether it's coming from space, from radioactive elements in the Earth, or from human activity, ionizing radiation is passing through us everywhere we go, anywhere on the planet. Radioactive decay producing alpha, beta, or gamma radiation is happening all the time, and curiously, some objects in daily life are noticeably more radioactive than others! Welding rods, camping gas mantles, smoke detectors, granite table tops and even bananas, they all produce radiation of different types and different energies.\r\n\r\nOne instrument to detect ionizing radiation is a Geiger-Müller tube, a simple gas filled tube. When exposed to high energy radiation, the inert gas inside is ionized and able to transport electrical charges. These charges can be detected using an electronic circuit, and visualised or sent to a speaker to produce the typical ticking sound often associated with radioactivity in popular culture.\r\n\r\nIn this workshop, attendees learn about the different types of ionizing radiation, and proceed to build their own Geiger counter based on an authentic 1970s Soviet Geiger-Müller tube. Because let's be honest: everyone loves a bit of Soviet nostalgia! This requires basic soldering and electronics skills. Once built, attendees calibrate their instrument and test it with different radiation sources.

Whether it's coming from space, from radioactive elements in the Earth, or from human activity, ionizing radiation is passing through us everywhere we go, anywhere on the planet. Radioactive decay producing alpha, beta, or gamma radiation is happening all the time, and curiously, some objects in daily life are noticeably more radioactive than others! Welding rods, camping gas mantles, smoke detectors, granite table tops and even bananas, they all produce radiation of different types and different energies.\r\n\r\nOne instrument to detect ionizing radiation is a Geiger-Müller tube, a simple gas filled tube. When exposed to high energy radiation, the inert gas inside is ionized and able to transport electrical charges. These charges can be detected using an electronic circuit, and visualised or sent to a speaker to produce the typical ticking sound often associated with radioactivity in popular culture.\r\n\r\nIn this workshop, attendees learn about the different types of ionizing radiation, and proceed to build their own Geiger counter based on an authentic 1970s Soviet Geiger-Müller tube. Because let's be honest: everyone loves a bit of Soviet nostalgia! This requires basic soldering and electronics skills. Once built, attendees calibrate their instrument and test it with different radiation sources. Attendees can choose to take their Geiger counter home after the workshop.","link":"https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2022/453-build-your-own-geiger-counter"}},{"start":"2022-06-04T10:00:00+01:00","venue":"Workshop 4","event":{"type":"workshop","title":"Morning Demoshow","speaker":"FieldFX","pronouns":"","description":"Morning Demoshow","link":"https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2022/431-morning-demoshow"}},{"start":"2022-06-04T10:00:00+01:00","venue":"Workshop 5","event":{"type":"workshop","title":"Building a Wearable Captioning Badge","speaker":"Kevin Lewis","pronouns":"he/him","description":"Masks are important for safety but they can make it hard for people to understand what's being said.

Through cover disks and PD (public domain) libraries I discovered Med, Sound Tracker, and  Octamed, all classic trackers.  But it was in 1993 when I joined the Amiga demoscene as a young teen that my eyes, ears, and mind were really opened.  Donning the handle Reflex, I first joined a group called Eltech and then later Grasshopper Developments, two mid-tier demogroups of the UK scene. Protracker was the standard that literally everybody on the scene used. I didn't release tons of stuff back then, but I was horse famous for a bit with some cheeky chip tunes and sampled songs about grasshoppers.","link":"https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2022/68-how-to-make-a-cool-90s-protracker-module-on-an-amiga-or"}},{"start":"2022-06-04T14:00:00+01:00","venue":"Workshop 5","event":{"type":"workshop","title":"Building mathematical structures with modular origami","speaker":"Lydia Monnington","pronouns":"she/her","description":"Work together to build the platonic solids.\r\n\r\nCreate core units and combine them into a range of different shapes. \r\n\r\nExplore the range of shapes you can create.   \r\n\r\nAdditionally: Bring your old train tickets or cards.

The mythical \"Philosopher's stone\" was thought to be the missing key needed for that, but much to the disappointment of generations of alchemists, the elusive Stone was never found, and the promise of unlimited wealth remained a dream. Until less than a century ago. \r\n\r\nWhen British physicist James Chadwick discovered the nature of the neutron in 1932, it soon became apparent that these subatomic particles can change the composition of an atom's nucleus. By adding neutrons to a nucleus, or removing neutrons from a nucleus, the atom can be made unstable and forced to undergo changes, now known as radioactive decay. These nuclear reactions can change an isotope of an element into another isotope of the same element, or even into an entirely different element. By choosing nuclear reactions and decays carefully, it becomes possible to turn other materials into gold. Traditionally, nuclear reactions require a very large and expensive nuclear reactor or particle accelerator, but a clever hacker doesn't need any of these! \r\n\r\nThis workshop starts with a 30 minute entry level introduction to nuclear physics to explain attendees the scientific principles of elemental transmutation. Attendees then build together their own Philosopher's stone with components that can be found in any hardware store, and finally use it to transmute (a few atoms) of liquid mercury into gold. After the workshop, attendees have the option to take their creation home.","link":"https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2022/36-hacking-alchemy-turning-household-materials-into-gold"}}]

To hold these digital \"conversations\" with microbes, ALICE uses the Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) as a communications platform. MFCs are an organic energy source powered by microbes which facilitate contact between humans and microbes through electrical exchanges.

The hardest part is devising open-ended interaction, spaces that invite people to reveal their authentic selves, and to connect with those around.\r\n\r\nBut trends in technology have gone in the opposite direction. Whether it's for usability, profit, safety, profit or 'sparking joy', or profit (it's usually profit), 'User Experience Design' was the flavour of the 2010s. Human-Computer Interaction has become a very planned affair. And the more planned it gets, the less room there is for the ambiguous messy bits that make us human.\r\n\r\nCould it be another way? Presenting... \r\n✯✯✯ Rewilding Human-Computer Interaction ✯✯✯\r\nwhere, instead of designing micromanaged user experiences, we create open-ended spaces that embrace the unknown, the messy and the human. The ills of the online world are not problems inherent to its users but to systems that prevent those users from existing fully as humans. The solution is not more design, but more wildness.\r\n\r\nSoapbox aside, I do have a speculative project to share on this front.\r\n\r\nIn a collaboration with artist/AI researcher Panagiotis Tigas, we've been training Variational Autoencoders on improvised dance, and from these devising personalised interfaces that respond to creative movement.

Thus began a decade of film production that would have phenomenal overseas impact but be almost totally forgotten in Britain. \r\n\r\nBetween 1940–1950, the British Council produced over 120 short documentary-style films about life in Britain covering sports, manufacturing, landscapes, art, architecture, public healthcare, the justice system, democratic process, public institutions like the National Trust and the BBC, and more besides. \r\nA far cry from the Ministry of Information's rigid style, this collection features some of the earliest works by winning cinematographers Geoffrey Unsworth (2001: A Space Odyssey, Cabaret, Superman), and Jack Cardiff (A Matter of Life and Death, Black Narcissus, The Red Shoes). \r\n\r\nDistributed to over 100 countries worldwide, the films are stunning, dated, funny, and bizarre by turn. They depict beautiful countrysides, optimistic cities, strong industry, forward-thinking social structures, and hardworking, happy people. They depict exactly the popular image of 1940s Britain that persists to this day... \r\nThat may not be a coincidence. \r\n\r\nIn this talk I'll cover the history and development of this film collection, how it was shaped, who saw the films, their staggering success, and their untold global legacy.","link":"https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2022/281-this-is-britain-british-cultural-propaganda-films-of-the"}},{"start":"2022-06-05T11:20:00+01:00","venue":"Stage C","event":{"type":"talk","title":"Making technology deliberately distinguishable from magic: designing the BBC micro:bit","speaker":"Jonny Austin","pronouns":"He/Him","description":"Should we really be trying to make our tech indistinguishable from magic? Is there dark magic in tech? And what does that have to do with a teleporting duck in a classroom?!\r\n\r\nWe often hold creating 'a magical experience' as a key goal for design - it's fun, engaging, sometimes even playful, and it makes complex things look simple. But technological magic has a dark side too, especially when trying to help people learn and feel confident about technology.\r\n\r\nBy its nature, magic you experience is not under your control: it's a trick, and you're not supposed to be able to understand it; magic is inscrutable, and for many, that's disempowering.\r\n\r\nIn designing the BBC micro:bit and surrounding tools, we've thought a lot about the balance between the positive and the negative sides of creating of a magical experience.\r\n\r\nThis talk will reflect on our struggle to balance technical authenticity and honesty with the need to provide a high quality experience that excites and inspires students.\r\n\r\nIt will explain how we attempt to present simple, understandable analogs of more complicated, magical technology in order to help students gain a sense confidence with the tech around them.  However, it will also look at how we've resorted to using our own bits of (nearly) invisible magic to make this all work nicely in a classroom.\r\n\r\nThrough this discussion we'll look in detail at the presentation of the micro:bit's IO, the way the micro:bit's USB interface works, the microphone privacy LED, the web-based compiler and the simple radio communication.\r\n\r\nFinally, I will look beyond micro:bit at how using this concept of balancing transparency and magic can help us build better, more trustworthy tech.","link":"https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2022/267-making-technology-deliberately-distinguishable-from-magic"}},{"start":"2022-06-05T11:20:00+01:00","venue":"Workshop 2","event":{"type":"workshop","title":"What’s in the water?","speaker":"Isabel Bishop, Dhruv Kumar, Duncan Wilson","pronouns":"","description":"Join a group of ecologists and digital tech nerds to discover what’s living in the river and what it means for the environment.

In this workshop, we will be getting into the river to try to find the creatures that we have (hopefully!) recorded. We’ll demonstrate techniques that can be replicated by anyone, anywhere, to give a quick indication of how healthy or polluted a river is. We will start by listening to our recordings to see if we can guess what we have found. We will then give a 15-min crash course on identifying eight types of invertebrates that can be found in rivers, each of which indicates different environmental conditions. Under the direction of workshop participants, our workshop leads will get into the river and collect some wiggly creatures. Everyone will count which species we have found and we will finish with a score that indicates how healthy or polluted the river is. If we have time, we will also demonstrate some simple tests to detect pollutants in the water. Participants will receive information to take home with them about different techniques that they can use to monitor river health for themselves, ranging from in-river surveys to Arduino sensor builds.\r\n\r\nWarning: We are not planning for participants to go in the water, but they may come into contact with the water so please cover up any cuts or broken skin.\r\n\r\nIf you cannot make our workshop time slot then do come across to our \"what's in the water\" village - we plan to be around at midday on Fri / Sat to run informal workshops.","link":"https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2022/246-what-s-in-the-water"}}]

Why then does it feel so incredibly hard to make these collaborations happen in reality? And why does it feel even harder to do it while meaningfully fighting the Tories, transphobes, racists, and neo-Nazis?\r\n\r\nThis talk takes it back to the roots of why we are here and what we’re doing to explore why. I will break down how harmful neoliberal methodologies that dominate tech groupthink such as Human Centered Design and Design Thinking fundamentally restrict what can be made whilst presenting a cardboard cutout “ethics” that falls over at the slightest touch.\r\n\r\nInstead I introduce Community Technology Partnerships, a methodology developed at Geeks for Social change in collaboration with Manchester School of Architecture, based on “the capability approach”. This is a human development approach used by the UN and WHO developed by Martha Nussbaum and Amartya Sen that asks what people are able to *be* and *do,* and works to remove blockers to these concrete actions and states. This approach recentres community strengths at the centre of more holistic tech interventions that restore power to the people who need it the most.\r\n","link":"https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2022/239-why-is-it-so-hard-to-do-nice-things-that-make-a-difference"}}]

Eschewing the oscillators of a traditional synthesiser for the resonances of homemade electro-acoustic sound sources and piezo based noise boxes, these are heavily processed with granular synthesis and micro looping using a palette of effects he has designed and built and housed in a repurposed bright orange metal chest. Taking cues from the world of sound art and horror film soundtracks but always trying to apply pop sensibilities, the result is lush and cinematic soundscapes topped with delicate melody.\r\n\r\nAs well as an immersive show in its own right, this performance will provide a good companion piece to Scott Pitkethly's talk (An introduction to building your own digital audio effects) on building the instruments he will be using to play live.\r\n\r\nwww.cutlasses.co.uk\r\nhttps://youtu.be/-l6Uslur_pQ\r\nhttps://youtu.be/Y7O-DpSKAu4\r\nhttps://youtu.be/xWpq3soblYY","link":"https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2022/39-music-cutlasses"}}]
